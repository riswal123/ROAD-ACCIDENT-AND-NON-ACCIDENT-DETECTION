# Road Accidental and Non-Accidental Image Classification Project

## Overview

The Road Accidental and Non-Accidental Image Classification project aims to leverage image analysis to enhance road safety. By developing a robust system capable of analyzing images of road accidents, we can derive valuable insights to make informed decisions for accident prevention and overall road safety improvement.

## Project Features

- Image classification for distinguishing between accidental and non-accidental scenes on the road.
- Integration with accident analysis platforms for in-depth understanding of accident causes and patterns.
- Facilitation of targeted interventions and policy formulation based on comprehensive accident data.

## Key Benefits

- Improved road safety through proactive accident prevention measures.
- Deeper insights into the causes and patterns of road accidents.
- Informed decision-making for policymakers and relevant authorities.
- Contribution to creating safer roads for everyone.
